# PearTree-OS-Expand
PearTree OS Expand is an operating system/operating system tool inspired by the MS-DOS Operating system. It has a built in interpreted language named BASECAP. BASECAP is frequently updated to have more commands and to expand the language and add more creativity while still being easy to learn. The operating system is open sourced but takes a price, to download everything and set up the operating system just read the setup text file.

Keep in mind this is open sorced but you need to put a disclaimer that shows you have taken the code from this repository.
